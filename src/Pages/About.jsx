        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2020 during the global pandemic, FitChallenge was born from the need to keep people active and
          connected when traditional gyms were closed. Our founders, Sarah Mitchell and Dr. James Wilson, recognized
          that fitness is more than just physical exerciseâ€”it's about community, motivation, and shared goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          What started as a simple app for tracking workout challenges has evolved into a comprehensive platform
          serving over 500,000 users worldwide. We've helped people complete more than 2 million challenges, lose over
          1 million pounds collectively, and build lasting friendships through fitness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we continue to innovate with cutting-edge features like AI-powered personalization, real-time
          competition modes, and integration with popular fitness wearables. Our commitment remains the same: making
          fitness fun, social, and achievable for everyone.
